                    <p class="mb-5"><strong>Tip: </strong>LinkedIn is a great platform to land recruiter calls, but it
                        does require
                        persistence. Do not hesitate to reach out to strangers. I heard back from recruiters of
                        companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Snapchat, Bloomberg,
                        and Apple simply by sending a message. Luckily, an email I sent in August landed me a recruiter
                        call from Facebook.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Tip: </strong>Getting the first recruiter call is the most time-consuming part of a job
                        hunt. Start applying for open positions despite feeling unprepared. You can ask your recruiter
                        for months-long preparation time before scheduling
                        your first interview.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="mb-5">Gotta Nail It </h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">I scheduled my technical screen two weeks later. The interview format is to solve
                        two questions
                        within 45 minutes. The questions were basic and easy to code (array and string problem). One
                        topic I want to touch on right now is the
                        <em><strong>test run</strong></em>.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Test Run: </strong>Your code is not compiled and executed in the interview. Hence, for
                        verification, the interviewer asks to take test input and show how it would run through your
                        code.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Tip: </strong>A test run is a good way to debug your code during an interview. Be sure
                        to include test runs in your interview preparation.
                        <br>For the interviewerâ€™s second question, I thought of two solutions and explained both to the
                        interviewer. He then asked me to compare the solutions and analyse the advantages of one over
                        the other. Five minutes are reserved at the end
                        to ask questions of the interviewer. I donâ€™t think these five minutes contribute to the
                        candidateâ€™s performance evaluation, so thereâ€™s nothing to worry about.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Tip: </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                                                 href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question">Leetcode</a> is
                        known to be a really good website to prepare for interviews, and I back this. One lesser-known
                        gem on Leetcode
                        is <em><strong>Leetcode Discuss</strong></em>. People share their interview experiences (and
                        questions) on this page, and believe me, questions do repeat.

                    <h3 class="mb-5">Onsite Interview</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">Facebookâ€™s interview process is pretty quick. I heard back from the recruiter within
                        two days and
                        flew to London for my onsite round. A total of four interviews were scheduled.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        <strong>Coding interviews (x 2) </strong>
                        <br> Two questions are asked which need to be solved within 45â€“50 minutes. Areas covered were
                        binary trees, string, stack, and list. Discuss the solution first with the interviewer and then
                        write your code on the whiteboard.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Tip: </strong>There are always edge cases that need to be tackled in the code, and itâ€™s
                        not easy to take care of them while coding under pressure. One technique that has helped me get
                        through this is the test run. Immediately after
                        coding the solution, I tell the interviewer that I am going to test-run my solution on a generic
                        example and debug myself first.
                        <br>The obvious mistakes in code are brought out by the first test run itself â€” better to find
                        them yourself than to have them pointed out by the interviewer. Running through these test runs
                        provides the time to think about edge cases
                        which can then be incorporated into the code.

                        <strong>System design interview </strong>
                        <br> This is an interesting round new for entry-level software engineers. The aim is to design a
                        system from scratch. The problem statement usually looks like this:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p> Design an existing product like WhatsApp, Facebook, Google search, etc.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> Design a particular feature of one of these applications; say, implement a timeline in a
                                Facebook app.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> Design a completely hypothetical scenario; say, create a system to store logs of three
                                servers situated far apart.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                        <br><em>This interview definitely requires a special kind of preparation, and the most famous

                        <br>
                        <br> The good part is there are no correct answers. You should be able to justify your design
                        choices and know the tradeoffs you have made.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Behavioral interview </strong> <br>This is the easiest of all, but do not take it
                        lightly because any red flags raised in this interview can cost you your selection. The
                        questions revolve around non-technical experiences like leadership
                        skills, team spirit, how you tackle disagreement, etc. This set of questions is almost fixed,
                        hence answers can be prepared.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Tip: </strong>A day before the interview, go through the list of popular behavioral
                        questions and think about anecdotes from your professional life that support your answer to the
                        question. Use this interview to relax in between
                        the series of technical interviews. The confidence boost from this round helps in raising
                        morale.

                    <p>Many people have a hunch about their college and feel they might not get recognized, not being
                        from a top tier university. I assure you that insecurity would go away once you read through the

                        <br> <em>Iâ€™ve broken down the preparation one goes through in 4 stages, start reading from the
                            section that resonates the most with you. </em>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>STAGE 1: </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        If you havenâ€™t selected a programming language OR have chosen it in the near past then read
                        along.
                        <br>
                        <br> You can choose any language C++, Java, Python, etc. If you're absolutely new I'll recommend
                        starting with C++. If you have chosen a language don't worry since the target is to get good in
                        one language, you can later learn other languages
                        according to your requirements since it's not a hard task picking up a new lang if you have a
                        grasp on some other. <br>Once you've chosen a language, try going through language-specific
                        training on platforms like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                                                      href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp">Solve C++ Code
                        Challenges</a>. You should complete at least 70% of the questionnaire before proceeding, which
                        is around 30 problems.
                        <br>
                        <br> Now start giving contests on platforms like codeforces, codechef, hackerearth. For
                        codeforces you would be starting in division 2(div2), try to participate in as many live and
                        virtual contests you can. Once you feel comfortable in
                        solving div2 A and B problems every time and C sometimes, proceed to the next stage.
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>STAGE 2: </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are able to always solve div2 B and sometimes div2 C(during the contest) read along: <br><br>Start
                        solving div2 C (only) from all the previous contests. You'll encounter topics like graphs,
                        dynamic programming, number theory. Soak
                        the concepts in as you go. The strategy here would be to try for at least 15 minutes on a
                        problem. Only if you don't get any clue proceed to the solution. Read it once, twice, thrice..
                        till it makes sense and study the related algorithms.
                        Now write the code yourself without referring to other's code. Continue doing that till you're
                        able to do at least div2 (A, B, C) everytime during the contest. Once you're done with this,
                        move on to the next stage.
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>STAGE 3: </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are able to always solve div2 C and sometimes div2 D (during the contest) read along:
                        <br>Try the above approach now with div2 D problems. You'll encounter trickier problems with a
                        wide variety of concepts coupled together.
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>STAGE 4: </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are able to always solve div2 C and majority times div2 D say at least 7 out of 10 times,
                        kudos! It means you have a strong grasp of language and have great algorithmic and data
                        structure concepts. You should try to give contests Google holds yearly
                        like Kickstart and CodeJam. If you do good in it, there is a high chance you could get a call
                        from the recruiter! <br><br>Once you feel comfortable at stage 3 or are at 4, try for the job
                        postings on the career page or
                        referrals from your friends. Read interview experiences and past asked problems from interview
                        preparation sites. You won't get any repeated questions but you'll get an idea what they're
                        looking for ðŸ˜ƒ.

                        I never expected switching jobs to be this difficult. Those of you who are struggling with it, I
                        can relate to the frustration. Things donâ€™t always go as planned, and there is the role of
                        chance or luck in the interview process. A Sanskrit quote from
                        the Bhagavad Gita that keeps me sane in such times:
